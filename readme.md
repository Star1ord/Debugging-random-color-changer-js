today, debugged a random color changing page as a part of freecodecamp.org 's curriculum.

You are supposed to click on button, and color of the site should randomly change, but it doesn't happen.
There are several reasons why it doesn't and step-by-step solution should be implemented to complete this task.

Learned how to resolve various errors, like: 
-SyntaxError
-ReferenceError
-TypeError

and understood more of null, undefined, NaN values.
